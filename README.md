# Business Analytics Project: Conversion Funnel & Retention Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project simulates the role of a junior analyst at an e-commerce company. Using raw transaction logs of user activity, I analyzed how well the website converts product views into purchases and how long customers are retained over time. The project was completed in **Google Sheets**, applying pivot tables, formulas, and cohort analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Key Analyses
- **Conversion Funnel** â€“ Tracked unique users through three stages (product view â†’ cart â†’ purchase).  
- **Cohort Analysis** â€“ Grouped users into cohorts based on their first purchase month and tracked behavior over time.  
- **Retention Rates** â€“ Calculated month-over-month retention for each cohort to evaluate long-term customer engagement.  

## ðŸ”‘ Key Findings

### Conversion Funnel
- Of **10,453 users** who viewed a product, **29%** added an item to their cart, and **10%** completed a purchase.  
- Once users add items to their cart, over a **third (36%)** follow through to purchase.  
- This suggests the **checkout flow is effective**, but the **main opportunity lies in boosting product engagement** to encourage more cart additions.  

### Retention Rates
- **Decreasing Retention Over Time**: As expected, retention generally declined month by month.  
  - Example: the **2020-08 cohort** had 12.50% retention at Month 1, dropping to 6.25% at Month 2, 0.00% at Month 3, and 3.13% at Month 4 (an anomaly worth noting).  
- **Cohort Performance Varies**: The **2020-10 cohort** started stronger (7.49% at Month 1) compared to **2020-11 (5.46%)**, but both declined sharply thereafter.  
- **Recent Cohorts**: The **2021-01 cohort** shows 6.87% retention at Month 1, while the **2021-02 cohort** shows **0.00% retention** â€” a red flag that may indicate an issue with acquisition quality or engagement.
