# Business Analytics Project: Conversion Funnel & Retention Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project simulates the role of a junior analyst at an e-commerce company. Using raw transaction logs of user activity, I analyzed how well the website converts product views into purchases and how long customers are retained over time. The project was completed in **Google Sheets**, applying pivot tables, formulas, and cohort analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Key Analyses
- **Conversion Funnel** â€“ Tracked unique users through three stages:  
  1. Product Page Views  
  2. Cart Adds  
  3. Purchases  
  Calculated total conversion rate and stage-to-stage conversion rates.

- **Cohort Analysis** â€“ Grouped users into cohorts based on their first purchase month and tracked behavior over time.

- **Retention Rates** â€“ Calculated month-over-month retention for each cohort to evaluate long-term customer engagement.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Findings
- Conversion from product views to purchase was approximately **<<insert %>>** overall.  
- Retention dropped significantly after month 2, with only **<<insert %>>** of users active in month 4.  
- Seasonal spikes were observed in **August (back-to-school)** and **December (holidays)**.  
- The **Technology** category showed the highest return rates, followed by Furniture.
